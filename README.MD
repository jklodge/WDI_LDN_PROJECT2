# GA WDI-32 Project 2 - Is this in?

For our second project, we were given 5 days to build a web application using Node.js and EJS.

#### [Visit website](is-this-in.herokuapp.com) for best viewing experience.

##### Is this in is a web application for users who want to share their outfits for fellow users to judge.

##### User journey

1. The homepage of the website features users outfits with voting system buttons.

2. Without logging in, the user can see the show pages of the outfits and the users profiles but they cannot vote, or follow users.


3. Upon registering and logging in, there is a flash message that welcomes the user back. The user can now favorite an outfit and vote for their favorites.

##### Future Features

If I had more time, I would have made this mobile first, to improve the user journey.
